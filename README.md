Painless deployment of wireguard on kubernetes

## Support and discussions

If you are facing any problems please open an [issue](https://github.com/jodevsa/wireguard-operator/issues) or start a

## Tested with
- [x] IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
- [x] Gcore Labs KMP
  * requires `spec.enableIpForwardOnPodInit: true`
- [x] Google Kubernetes Engine
  * requires `spec.mtu: "1380"`
  * Not compatible with "Container-Optimized OS with containerd" node images
  * Not compatible with autopilot
- [x] DigitalOcean Kubernetes
  * requires `spec.serviceType: "NodePort"`. DigitalOcean LoadBalancer does not support UDP. 
- [ ] Amazon EKS
- [ ] Azure Kubernetes Service
- [ ] ...?

## Architecture 

![alt text](./readme/main.png)

## Features 
* Falls back to userspace implementation of wireguard [wireguard-go](https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-go) if wireguard kernal module is missing
* Automatic key generation
* Automatic IP allocation
* Does not need persistance. peer/server keys are stored as k8s secrets and loaded into the wireguard pod
* Exposes a metrics endpoint by utilizing [prometheus_wireguard_exporter](https://github.com/MindFlavor/prometheus_wireguard_exporter)

## Example

### Server

```
apiVersion: vpn.wireguard-operator.io/v1alpha1
kind: Wireguard
metadata:
  name: "my-cool-vpn"
spec:
  mtu: "1380"
```

### Peer

```
apiVersion: vpn.wireguard-operator.io/v1alpha1
kind: WireguardPeer
metadata:
  name: peer1
spec:
  wireguardRef: "my-cool-vpn"
```

#### Peer configuration

Peer configuration can be retrieved using the following command:

```console
kubectl get wireguardpeer peer1 --template={{.status.config}} | bash
```

After executing it, something similar to the following will be shown. Use this config snippet to configure your
preferred Wireguard client:

```console
[Interface]
PrivateKey = WOhR7uTMAqmZamc1umzfwm8o4ZxLdR5LjDcUYaW/PH8=
Address = 10.8.0.3
DNS = 10.48.0.10, default.svc.cluster.local
MTU = 1380

[Peer]
PublicKey = sO3ZWhnIT8owcdsfwiMRu2D8LzKmae2gUAxAmhx5GTg=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = 32.121.45.102:51820
```

## How to deploy
```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jodevsa/wireguard-operator/releases/download/v2.1.0/release.yaml
```

## How to remove
```
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/jodevsa/wireguard-operator/releases/download/v2.1.0/release.yaml
```
